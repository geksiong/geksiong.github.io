  I'm interested in software engineering and architecture, and all things technical, and guiding technical teams to build products that meet business needs and delight end-users.

  I had been involved in all stages of the product delivery lifecycle, from pre-sales, project management and service delivery, technical design and architecture, to post-release operations and continual improvements. I had the opportunity to work with many brilliant engineers over the years, both local and off-shore.

  Currently I take care of a department of mostly software engineers to deliver products for customers. Although my responsibilities are beyond technical concerns now, I still keep myself update to date on the latest technology trends, tools and frameworks, and I do "talk tech" with my team and sometimes get my hands dirty.

  In a previous life, I was a government scholar serving in the areas of industry development and outsourced project management.

  I hold a BS in EECS from UC Berkeley, and an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University.

  I (still) am a Certified Scrum Master.
