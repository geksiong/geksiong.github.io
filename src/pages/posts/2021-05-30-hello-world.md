> Update: 2022-03-26: I've switched over from VuePress to Astro

It's been years since I last maintained a blog. I've been keeping random notes here and there in various places, and one day I just thought I should adopt a more organised approach to my learning and note-taking.

I'm building this blog using VuePress.

Why VuePress?

I've tried Hugo, Eleventy and Nuxt Content, and liked them enough to start building a blog and theme using them, but due to other commitments the attempts fizzled out. I almost settled on Eleventy, then remembered VuePress and decided to give it another chance.

The various Static Site Generators each have their own strengths, but my primary criteria for a Static Site Generator is the extendability of the Markdown engine. Standard markdown is just too limiting for technical content. While Hugo is really fast, I don't see myself picking up Go just so that I can extend its custom markdown engine. I personally prefer the ecosystem of markdown-it plugins, after having used it with Eleventy, and VuePress also uses markdown-it.

I hope to upload more content soon!
