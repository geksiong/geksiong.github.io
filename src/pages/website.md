title: About This Website
---
Hi I'm GS. This blog is where I keep my notes and write about mostly tech stuff.

I've been around in the tech industry since the dotcom bubble days, and I've done project management, software architecture, and presales. Currently I'm leading a team of talented software engineers to deliver full-stack software solutions using agile development methodology for clients. Although my job focuses more on managing people nowadays, I still try to keep in touch with my technical skills. My primary interests are in software engineering, security and DevOps. I'm constantly looking for the perfect application development platform.
